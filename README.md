# What does it take to get a PhD?

## So what does it take to get a Ph.D.?

Besides the obvious (e.g., taking classes, writing a dissertation), you need some publication at a conference or journal in your field (with you as the major author of the publication). The latter is the _unwritten rule of the game_ that most young students are unaware/uncertain of when coming into a Ph.D. program. Then later they find out how difficult it is to publish an original research paper. They get depressed or straight drop out of school.

Many think the Ph.D. is just another five-year extension to their undergraduate education. This cannot be further from the truth. In North America, a Ph.D. is usually paid to be there, including all tuition with a stipend. Many Ph.D. candidates do not even take classes (they transfer all the credits from their undergraduate/master programs). Their sole purpose of being there is to publish as many papers as possible with their advisors. In fact, this is the ideal type of a Ph.D. candidate because the student does not need to "waste time on taking classes" and can "focus on research".

## What if I don't have any publication but want the degree?

Chances are your advisor will not let you graduate. If advisors perceive you are entitled to the degree and not interested in publication, they will ghost you or sideline you until you show up with "the right attitude". If your advisor does not want you to graduate, you will not graduate. Sometimes, advisors will straight fire you from the research group if they sense you are not working at a satisfiable pace towards publication, since that is "a waste of their money".

There are exceptions to this but they are very rare. In any case, if you go out a Ph.D. program without any publication, you are considered a failed student. The point here is that you are really really expected to have it.

## Why is publication so important?

In academia, it is "publish or perish". It is very easy to judge a person with the number of papers on their CV than actually looking at what they do. The latter is considered "subjective". Professors who do not have tenureship care especially about publications because their prospect of tenureship directly hinges on the number of papers they can produce in a five-year assistant professorship period. Tenured professors care about publications because it is a status symbol. Those with more papers tend to have more say in the department. They are also more likely to obtain funding, which sometimes allow them pay their way out of teaching duties. The department and school care about publications because it affects funding and the rating of the university.

The point here is that publications are the commonly valued currency in the academic world. A lot of real-world benefits are directly tied to the number of papers under one's title, and you, as a powerless graduate student, are expected to do the heavy lifting for the professors.

## But my advisor is supposed to help me with that, right?

It is more than likely that your advisor will only provide you with some basic equipments and leave the rest entirely to you. Do not expect your advisor to hold hands at all.

## Then how am I supposed to do this?!

Most successful Ph.D. students usually already have a "gig" _before_ they come into the program. For example, they may already published papers during their undergraduate or master years, or at least have deep experiences working with established graduate students in department research labs.

It is ideal that these are the only students the professors can hire because such students are competitive and self-sufficient, requiring little advisor attention while delivering maximum publication output. But in reality if the admission standards are this high, most professors will have trouble finding students. This leads professors to hire underqualified students, but the expectation remains the same, leading to unhappy and struggling Ph.D.s.

## Main takeaways

* A Ph.D. position is a job instead of school.

* Your advisor is your boss instead of your teacher.

* If you want to pursue a Ph.D., have a gig _before_ you come in to minimize risk and pain.
